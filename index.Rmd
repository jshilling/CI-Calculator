## Why a Conficence Interval (CI) Calculator?

1. People (often bosses) ask for estimates all the time
2. They typically want a single number, buy you don't typically have all the information
3. A single point estimate often provides the illusion of precision
4. It is better all around if you provide a reasonable range

## Motivating Example

Let's say you have a record of the last 30 times you've performed a particular job and the times have a nearly normal distribution with mean 25 days and standard deviation of 3 days, ~N(25, 3).  The histogram might look something like this:
```{r, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 4, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
hist(rnorm(30, 25,3))
```

You could say the task will take 25 days plus or minus 3 (the standard deviation).  But a more accurate answer is to use a confidence interval.

## Calculating a Confidence Interval

- The Confidence Interval is $\bar x \pm z * s/\sqrt{n}$, where  
  - $\bar x$ is the sample mean  
  - $z$ is the z-score for the confidence level (CL)  
    - at a 90% CL, $Z$ = 1.645  
    - at a 95% CL, $Z$ = 1.96  
    - at a 99% CL, $Z$ = 2.58  
  - $s$ = the sample standard deviation, and  
  - $n$ = the number of observations in the sample  
- In this case, $\bar x$ = 25, $s$ = 3, and $n$ = 30. So at a 99% confidence level, the confidence interval is   
$
25 \pm 2.58 * 3/sqrt(30) = (23.6, 26.4)
$

- So the job estimate becomes "I'm 99% sure it will be between 24 and 27 days."  And that's more realistic than committing to exactly 25 days and more accurate than 22 to 28 days.

## The CI-Calculator

The Confident Interval Calculator ([CI-Calculator] (https://shilling.shinyapps.io/CI-Calculator/)) makes calculating confidence intervals for nearly normal distributions as easy as 1-2-3  
<img src="./assets/img/CI-Calc.jpg" height=300 align="right">  

1. Launch the the [CI-Calculator] (https://shilling.shinyapps.io/CI-Calculator/) app  
2. Enter the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and the number of observations  
3. Select the confidence level you want  

The outputs include  
- The Standard Error ($s/\sqrt{n}$)
- The margin of error ($z * s/\sqrt{n}$)
- And the Lower and Upper bounds of the confidence interval for the nearly normal distribution with the parameters provided as inputs.

## Planned Improvements

- Add a drop-down box that allows the user to select from the following distributions:
  - t-distribution  
  - binomial  
  - Chi-Squared  
  - F

- Add a graph of the expected distribution of the means with a range bar showing the confidence interval along the x-axis
